**Describe the bug**
<!--- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

**To Reproduce**
<!---
Please add the flag `--debug` your command and post its output here. **MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT POSTING ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION!** This includes any information shown for your saved password accounts (name, username, password, notes, folder, fields, etc.). The logs _should_ obfuscate away any sensitive info from your logs on its own, but its always safer to double check!
-->

<!---
There is also an additional flag `--debug-unsafe` which _will_ display the obfuscated data. This can be helpful for finding tricky bugs, but it also shows your sensitive data. If there is anything interesting found when running with `--debug-unsafe` that `--debug` did not cover, you can attach that log and overwrite values that may be sensitive with `foo`/`bar`/etc.
